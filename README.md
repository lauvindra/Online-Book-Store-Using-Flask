# 1.Introduction

Web Frameworks are the foundation of web development.There are two types of framework which are **full-stack frameworks** and **microframeworks** (sometimes called non-full-stack).Choosing a full-stack framework, you will have a variety of tools and packages at hand to develop any kind of application. Those are MVC architecture,ORM(object-relational mapping),routers,templating engine,security,and more.

Full-stack frameworks are sizeable because they contain several modules, components and services.

A micro framework, on the other hand, fits into a single code source file.As such, it’s used whenever minimum coding is required like small applications and REST-based apps. 

You can also use clone this project to download all the required plugins and datasets:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lauvindra/Online-Book-Store-Using-Flask.git
```
# 2. Objective 

* To create a book store web application using a microframeworks
* To enable the web application to Create,Read,Update,Delete 
* Use Object-relational mapping(ORM) for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming technique.

# 3. Flask

* Flask is a microframework, which means it is more focused on simplicity and less on functions.
* Microframeworks lack functionality but they can be extended with databases and templating engines.
* It is a lightweight modular framework and can be adapted to a variety of tasks.It has a number of useful features, such as an integrated development server and a quick debugger, Jinja2 template engine, support for secure cookies, the ability to connect any ORM.
* Jinja2 template engine is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code.
