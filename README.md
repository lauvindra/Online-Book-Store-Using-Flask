# 1.Introduction

Web Frameworks are the foundation of web development.There are two types of framework which are **full-stack frameworks** and **microframeworks** (sometimes called non-full-stack).Choosing a full-stack framework, you will have a variety of tools and packages at hand to develop any kind of application. Those are MVC architecture,ORM(object-relational mapping),routers,templating engine,security,and more.

Full-stack frameworks are sizeable because they contain several modules, components and services.

A micro framework, on the other hand, fits into a single code source file.As such, itâ€™s used whenever minimum coding is required like small applications and REST-based apps. 

You can also use clone this project to download all the required plugins and datasets:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lauvindra/Online-Book-Store-Using-Flask.git
```
# 2. Objective 

* To create a book store web application using a microframeworks
* To enable the web application to Create,Read,Update,Delete 
* Use Object-relational mapping(ORM) for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming technique.

# 3. Flask

* Flask is a microframework, which means it is more focused on simplicity and less on functions.
* Microframeworks lack functionality but they can be extended with databases and templating engines.
* It is a lightweight modular framework and can be adapted to a variety of tasks.It has a number of useful features, such as an integrated development server and a quick debugger, Jinja2 template engine, support for secure cookies, the ability to connect any ORM.
* Jinja2 template engine is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code. 

# 3. SQLAlchemy

* SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
* Instead of hiding away SQL and object relational details behind a wall of automation, SQLAlchemy's overall approaches all processes are fully exposed within a series of composable, transparent tools.
* A relationally-oriented query system, exposing the full range of SQL's capabilities explicitly, including joins, subqueries, correlation, and most everything else, in terms of the object mode

# 4.Online Book Store 
These are the implementation of Flask together with a database using Flask SQLAlchemy.
